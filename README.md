   cd fyenance_backend
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Open `fyenance_backend/settings.py` and configure the database settings as needed (default is SQLite).
   - Apply migrations:
     ```bash
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**

   ## React Setup Instructions
   To set up the React frontend, follow these steps:
   
   ## Step 1: Clone the Repository
   First, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate into the project folder
```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd fyenance_frontend
```

   ## Step 2: Install Dependencies
   Now, install all the required dependencies.
```bash
   npm install
```

   ## Step 3: Configure API Base URL
   Set the API base URL by creating an `.env` file.
```bash
   touch .env
   echo "REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000" >> .env
```
   Then, in your React code, you can use the API base URL like this:
```bash
   const baseURL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL;
```

   ## Step 4: Ignore Unnecessary Files
   To avoid pushing unnecessary files like `node_modules/` and `.env`, add them to your `.gitignore`.
```bash
   touch .gitignore
   echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```
   Then, commit the .gitignore file.
```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Added .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files"
```

   ## Step 5: Start the Development Server
   Run the development server to preview the app.
```bash
   npm start
```
   Once the server starts, open your browser and visit:
```bash
   http://localhost:3000
```

   ## Step 6: Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Set up initial React frontend and configuration"
   git push origin master
```
